Oxys - 5\*5 pixel font of the Greek alphabet
===

Oxys supports the Greek extended (diacritics & breathing marks) and archaic Greek alphabets, making it eligible for typesetting classical texts. Arabic numerals and puctuation are also supported. 
Typing Latin will result in the following corresponding Greek letters:

`A a B b C c D d E e F f G g H h I i J j K k L l M m N n O o P p Q q R r S s T t U u V v W w X x Y y Z z`

`Α α Β β X χ Δ δ Ε ε Φ φ Γ γ Η η Ι ι Φ φ Κ κ Λ λ Μ μ Ν ν O ο Π π Θ θ Ρ ρ Σ σ Τ τ Υ υ ς ϖ Ω ω Ξ ξ Ψ ψ Ζ ζ`

Letters are designed to be different for legibility. Breathing marks are placed to the left of letters in both upper and lower cases. Due to technical difficulties of 5\*5 grids, the glyphs `@` and `&` are different from conventional forms, with `&` reverting to *et* ligature. As Oxys is not a color font, little anti-aliasing can be done (though uppercase are designed to be less aliased than lowercase to enhance legibility), hense the name Ὀξύς (Oxys), which means "sharp, keen"  in ancient Greek.

The font is licensed under the SIL Open Font License.

I am currently working on different weights of this font. The goal is a multiweight family supporting Basic Latin (with Latin letters replaced with Greek), Greek extended, and archaic Greek. And a color font with anti-aliasing named "Oxeia" (ὀξεῖα, feminine of Ὀξύς) is also been developed.
